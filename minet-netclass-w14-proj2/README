Minet: A User-level Network Stack
=================================

Copyright (c) 2000 by Peter A. Dinda


This is a user-level network stack that is intended for use in
education.  It is not fast, but it tries to be clear and simple.  It
was developed to support an introductory course in networking at
Northwestern University, CS 340.  

More details can be found at
http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~pdinda/minet.  The first thing you
should read is the Minet technical report available at that web site.
This can be cited as:

P. Dinda, The Minet TCP/IP Stack, Northwestern University Department
of Computer Science Technical Report NWU-CS-02-08, January, 2002.

A number of people have contributed to the development of Minet, and
are mentioned in the technical report.  Items that are integrated into
the current release include:

Minet - the core distribution itself.
Minet Timeline - A post-mortem tool for looking at Minet log files.
Minet JavaGUI - A graphical interface to the Minet stack.

Shana Azria: ssa047
Cassandra Rommel: cro947

Shana Azria did the mux handler
Cassandra Rommel did the sock handler and the timeout handler

We were doing fine until we go to the established case in the mux handler. At this point
the code started looping each time going through the switches again and 
we could not figure out where it was coming from. 
Since we had implemented most of everything, we were unable to find the source of
the problem.
